## Project Status: Pièce Paradis

**Description:**
Pièce Paradis is an ongoing project aimed at creating a web application for selling car parts. The project now benefits from the functionality of authentication, a database, and an integrated API.
I've added the authentication system to provide users with a more secure experience and allow them to manage their accounts. Additionally, I've implemented a database to store and manage user and product data.
My API enables communication between the client and server, facilitating interaction with the database and accessing data within the application.

Moving forward, I'll continue to work on improving existing functionalities and adding new features to make the Pièce Paradis project more comprehensive and useful for users.

Thank you for your patience and support in the development of Pièce Paradis!
